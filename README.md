### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

This is my take on [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

I've translated the original C++ code into Rust, both as a learning exercise and a way to deepen my understanding of Rust's strengths and idioms.

The goal of this translation is to follow Rust best practices while staying mindful of performance trade-offs in design decisions.

### Running the Project

After cloning the repository, you can run the program with:

```bash
cargo run --release > output.ppm
